# Advanced React Coursera's Final Project

This project is part of the Advanced React final project where I implemented various React concepts which I have learned throughout the course. The project is a portfolio where users can submit their contact information, and it includes features such as form validation, state management, side-effect management, context implementation 
, handling user interactions, and using external libraries to create the interfaces.

## Features

- Implementation of conditional rendering for dynamic user interfaces

- Error handling and providing meaningful feedback to users
